Hello!

Welcome to my CV. This is a website I'm building to keep my skills sharp and to show to potential employers.
Over time I will add more to it, but for now it's basically a rehash of the CV I send out, with a little more information.
I plan to update it with individual pages for each section and a gallery of certificates, among other things.

Thanks for checking it out!
Adam
